# [EchelonPlanner](https://echelonplanner.noip.me)
SOEN341 Team Project for a Multiyear planner for Software Engineering Students

A Project made in Python's Django using MySQL
 
### Development

Project structure in this repository is split into two main directories under the "src" master directory:

1. ["app"](src/app) 

    This is the actual working EchelonPlanner app. Here you can see everything that pertains to the way the app was
    implemented and is working in the live site. This is the directory that should be used if the app ever need be 
    packaged.


2. ["echelon"](src/echelon)

    The 'echelon' directory deals mostly with our development specific setup. Most of it is deprecated since our initial
    deployment on [echelonplanner.me](echelonplanner.me) on April 8th, 2015. You should check this and make amendments if 
    you wish to start developing the app further.
    
    
To run the server, open a terminal prompt and change directory to "src" then input: "python manage.py runserver". 
This will create a basic web server for the Django app on localhost:8000
If you want to test a TLS server to test features, we recommend taking a look at [django-sslserver](https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver).
It Really Helped :)
