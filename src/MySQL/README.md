# MySQL Database Management

As a platform, MySQL is designed to reside on a single server and be accessed from several remote locations.
In our development cycle, this is not a practical solution since we do not have a centralized server that can host our DB.
Instead, we will be syncing the DB files over Github.

Only a couple of entries should be hard-coded into the DB and, in general, it should only be changing as we change the course listings here.

This directory holds all binary, thus merging will be impossible. Be careful not to overwrite other people's work.
