            <p>I am the very model of a modern student document</p>
            <p>I've information most informal, unstable, and fallible,</p>
            <p>My languages are weak-typed, and my programmers hysterical</p>
            <p>From writing to debugging 'tis a plight most diabolical</p>
            <p>I'm very well acquainted, too, with pages problematical</p>
            <p>I make fantastic schedules, both the robotic and manual</p>
            <p>About conflicting courses I am teeming with a lot o' news</p>
            <p>With many cheerful facts about the tables in the schedule views</p>
            <br>

            <p>With variables whose early names were nothing short of scandalous</p>

            <p>I am the very model of a modern student document!</p>
